## Project Overview

### User Stories

1. **Player Move**
   - As a player, I want to make a move by choosing an empty square, allowing me to place my symbol on the board.

2. **Current Game State**
   - As a player, I want to see the current state of the game, enabling me to keep track of moves made by both myself and my opponent.

3. **Game Outcome Notification**
   - As a player, I want to be notified when the game concludes in a win, loss, or draw, providing me with the result.

4. **Start New Game**
   - As a player, I want to initiate a new game after the current one ends, allowing me to play again.

### Tasks

1. **GitHub Setup**
   - Create a public GitHub repository.
   - Establish a GitHub project and link it to the created repository.

2. **User Stories Management**
   - Transfer user stories to a new Kanban board in the project.
   - Assign a unique ID to each user story.

3. **Java Maven Project Setup**
   - Create a new Java Maven project.
   - Initialize a new git repository.
   - Set the GitHub repository as a remote repository.

4. **Code Initialization**
   - Commit and push the blank Java project to the main branch.
   - Protect the main branch to allow only pull requests.

5. **Development Workflow**
   - Start working on user stories, creating a new feature branch for each story with a correct naming convention.
   - Merge the branch after completion via pull request.
   - Ensure CI/CD tests your code before merging.

6. **Kanban Board Maintenance**
   - Advance user stories on the Kanban board as tasks progress.

7. **CI/CD Deployment**
   - Configure CI/CD to deploy the application via the main branch, making the JAR file downloadable.
